Factbox: Major U.S. Supreme Court abortion rights cases,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Courtâs key rulings on abortion, dating to the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide, have long provoked social, religious and political tensions. As the court majority became more conservative over the decades, it set standards that enhance statesâ ability to regulate abortion. Yet even in the most recent rulings, extending to 2007, there have never been five votes on the nine-member court to reverse the fundamental right to abortion. Here is a look at the courtâs major abortion rulings. Roe v. Wade, 1973, 7-2 vote The court rules that a womanâs constitutional right to privacy protects her decision to end a pregnancy, and only a compelling state interest can justify regulating abortion. The decision institutes a three-part legal test, connected to a nine-month pregnancy and a fetusâ viability, that gives states more latitude for regulation with each trimester. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992, 5-4 vote The court affirms the right to abortion. Rather than the trimester framework, the test is whether a government regulation imposes an âundue burdenâ on a woman seeking an abortion by creating a âsubstantial obstacleâ to the procedure before the fetus develops to the point at which it becomes viable. Stenberg v. Carhart, 2000, 5-4 vote The court decides that a Nebraska ban on a late-term procedure critics call âpartial birth abortionâ violates a womanâs right to abortion. The procedure, known medically as âintact dilation and extraction,â involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. The justices fault the Nebraska ban, similar to laws in a majority of the states at the time, for its ambiguity about precisely what type of medical procedure is prohibited and for lacking an exception for the health of the mother. Gonzales v. Carhart, 2007, 5-4 vote The court decides that a federal Partial Birth Abortion Act, involving the same type of procedure as in the Nebraska dispute and without an exception for the womanâs health, is constitutional. The majority distinguishes the ruling from the 2000 case by noting that Congress developed findings that the procedure would never be necessary for the health of the mother. Another factor in the reversed course was that in 2000, Justice Sandra Day OâConnor had voted to strike down the partial-birth ban. She was succeeded by Samuel Alito in 2006, and in 2007 he cast the fifth vote in favor of the ban. Whole Womanâs Health v. Hellerstedt, 2016, 5-3 vote The court strikes down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities, finding that the 2013 statute put an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy. The court declares that both provisions of the law - requiring physicians who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain âadmitting privilegesâ at a local hospital and requiring clinics to install costly hospital-grade facilities - violate abortion rights. The ruling marked the firmest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights since the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey ruling.

McConnell will not give timeline for Obamacare replacement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday the Senate will move to repeal President Barack Obamaâs healthcare law shortly after Jan. 1, but declined to give a timeline for a plan to replace it. McConnell said the Senate would vote as soon as it returns from its year-end recess to repeal Obamacare. âAnd then we will work expeditiously to come up with a better program than current law, because current law is simply unacceptable and not sustainable,â he said. Asked repeatedly, McConnell did not give any timeline for when the Republicans would offer their own plan. He said they would be consulting with different âstakeholders.â Donald Trumpâs election as U.S. president last month means Republicans will control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives in 2017. The new Congress goes to work on Jan. 3; Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Republicans in both the Senate and House of Representatives say they want to repeal Obamacare early in 2017. But Republicans have not agreed on how quickly the Obamacare repeal should go into effect. A delay would give them time to work on a replacement, instead of throwing millions of Americans out of their health insurance with no substitute.

U.S. Defense Dept needs to better manage its finances: GAO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department needs to better manage its finances if it hopes to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces, the Government Accountability Office said in a report released on Tuesday. The Pentagon needs to give its decision makers and weapons buyers more accurate budget and cost information so they can make better decisions as they modernize weapons systems, the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trumpâs $4.1 trillion fiscal 2018 budget proposal included $603 billion in defense spending for the Department of Defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense priorities. The GAO report comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented lawmakers in the House and Senate with a $33 billion wish list of unfunded military needs. The report said despite increased defense funding under Trump, efforts âunderway to rebuild readiness for portions of their military forcesâ are at risk without more comprehensive planning efforts at the Pentagon.  The federal agency, which oversees government resources, also said the Defense Department could police global hot spots with less expensive and more numerous regular troops instead of U.S. special forces.  âDOD has not taken steps to examine whether additional opportunities exist to reduce the high demand on these (special) forces by sharing some of their responsibilities with conventional forces,â the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trumpâs fiscal 2018 budget proposal gave the military a modest boost to their budget, 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $574.5 billion for the Department of Defense would go to warfighting readiness and critical program requirements.  GAO said it has made approximately 3,100 recommendations to DOD since 2006. Of these about 1,037 have not been acted on, including 78 priority recommendations. The report released on Tuesday made no new recommendations.

Al Qaeda warns Myanmar of 'punishment' over Rohingya,"YANGON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda militants have called for support for Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims, who are facing a security crackdown that has sent about 400,000 of them fleeing to Bangladesh, warning that Myanmar would face  punishment  for its  crimes . The exodus of Muslim refugees from Buddhist-majority Myanmar was sparked by a fierce security force response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on police and army posts in the country s west on Aug. 25. The Islamist group behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the Untied States issued a statement urging Muslims around the world to support their fellow Muslims in Myanmar with aid, weapons and  military support .  The savage treatment meted out to our Muslim brothers ... shall not pass without punishment,  al Qaeda said in a statement, according to the SITE monitoring group.   The government of Myanmar shall be made to taste what our Muslim brothers have tasted.  Myanmar says its security forces are engaged in a legitimate campaign against  terrorists , whom it blames for attacks on the police and army, and on civilians. The government has warned of bomb attacks in cities, and al Qaeda s call to arms is likely to compound those concerns.

"Trump attacks Clinton on gender, risking backlash from women","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump waded into politically risky territory this week when he accused Democrat Hillary Clinton of exploiting her gender to win votes and said she would have little support if she were not a woman. As Trump and Clinton, fresh off big wins in five Northeastern state primaries on Tuesday, circled each other for a potential matchup in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, his comments portended what could be an unusually nasty campaign. Like other controversial remarks during his White House campaign, Trumpâs comments drew criticism from a wide spectrum but also reinforced his image - which has been attractive to some supporters - for plain talk that defies political norms. âThe only thing sheâs got going is the fact that sheâs a woman,â Trump, 69, said on Thursday on NBCâs âTodayâ show, refusing to back down from targeting Clinton, 68, for what he called âplaying the womanâs card.â     Trumpâs remarks, reaching into an area of gender attacks that is conventionally seen as off-limits, energized Democrats. âKeep talking, Donald Trump,â Democratic Committee National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN on Wednesday. âEvery single day when Donald Trump opens his mouth, he does more to alienate women.â Trump, unfazed by the criticism, told supporters in Evansville, Indiana, that he has gotten a bad rap. âNobody cherishes and nobody respects women more than Donald Trump,â he said after being introduced by famed former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight. âI will be so much better to women than Hillary Clinton.â Trump, who can be as free with his personal attacks on men,  has consistently polled poorly with women. Democrats and Republicans both accuse Trump of sexism over verbal insults lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. On Wednesday, Trumpâs closest Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, named Fiorina, 61, as his running mate should he win the partyâs nomination, a move that could help him draw womenâs support. âDonald has a problem with strong women,â Cruz, 45, told reporters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, before a rally. âThis is not subtle, itâs not complicated.â U.S. Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, who fended off a 2010 Senate challenge from Fiorina, said Trump is insulting all women when he attacks Clinton and other prominent women, such as Kelly, in this way. âEither Trump has spent too much time in his Trump Tower and has no clue about whatâs happening, or he truly dislikes women and are quite threatened by them,â Boxer said on MSNBC. But Trump said women would support his positions on security and jobs. U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers, a Republican who has endorsed him, said she believed Trump could overcome his unpopularity with women voters with his straight talk. âTo me, this is breaking all the rules, this is going against any of the typical history books and elections of the past,â she said. Trumpâs top aide and other supporters said focusing on Clintonâs gender was part of Trumpâs emerging strategy for the general election and that he had no intention of hewing to traditional rules. âWhen he is attacked, he will respond,â Trumpâs campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told Reuters. âThe campaign is going to proceed under the mantra, which weâve had in this campaign from Day One, which is: Let Mr. Trump be Mr. Trump.â A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month showed a big gender gap in opinions about Trump. About two-thirds of women had an unfavorable view of the billionaire businessman and former reality TV star, while 54 percent of men had a negative view of him. In her political career, Clinton has sometimes benefited from missteps by male candidates. Her 2000 U.S. Senate rival, New York Republican Rick Lazio, was seen as a bully when he stepped close to her on stage during a debate to demand she sign a pledge.  Early in her first presidential campaign in 2008, Clinton accused her male opponents of âpiling onâ and said that would prompt more women to support her. Then-Senator Barack Obamaâs comments during a debate in New Hampshire that year that she was âlikable enoughâ were seen by some as patronizing, and as helping her win the stateâs primary. If Trump wins the nomination, his willingness to raise Clintonâs gender and other issues could make for one of the most contentious general election campaigns in recent history. âI donât think thereâs going to be any taboos with Donald Trump,â said James Pethokoukis, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. âHeâs not going to treat her with any sort of kid gloves.â Retired U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, weighed in on the presidential race during a talk at Stanford University on Wednesday, according to the student newspaper, saying he could vote for his golfing and âtexting buddyâ Trump but harshly criticizing Cruz. âLucifer in the flesh,â Boehner said of Cruz, who is a staunch fiscal conservative and who angered many of his  colleagues in Congress by leading a government shutdown in 2013. âI get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life,â Boehner said. Cruz said Boehner was allowing âhis inner Trumpâ to come out. âWhat made John Boehner mad is that I led a movement of the people to hold Washington accountable,â Cruz told reporters.

Ex-soccer star Weah headed for presidential run-off in Liberia,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Former soccer star George Weah was set to win the first round of a presidential election in Liberia after the elections commission said on Sunday he was leading with 39 percent of votes and less than 5 percent of precincts still to be counted. He will face Vice President Joseph Boakai, who was in second place with 29.1 percent, in a second round poll next month.  Boakai was more than 280,000 votes ahead of the third placed candidate, lawyer Charles Brumskine, on 9.8 percent.  The final certified results from Tuesday s poll must be announced by Oct. 25. But with more than 1.5 million votes counted so far and 95.6 percent of polling stations having reported, it was mathematically impossible that Brumskine could move into second place.  Turnout based on votes counted so far was nearly 75 percent.  A total of 20 candidates competed in last week s poll seeking to succeed Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in what would be Liberia s first democratic transfer of power in more than 70 years. Weah and Boakai had both predicted outright victory in the first round. Supporters at Weah s headquarters in the capital Monrovia crowded around cars listening to the results broadcast on the radio and voiced frustration as it became clear that a second round of voting was unavoidable.  We need to be calm. But we are worried that they are going to cheat us. We feel disenchanted from 2005 and 2011. People say  no second round  because of the desire they have,  Weah supporter Luke Harris, 31, said. Weah, a national hero in Liberia, became the first non-European to win European soccer s player of the year award in 1995, the same year he picked up the African and world player of the year awards.  He finished runner-up to Johnson Sirleaf in a 2005 election that helped draw a line under years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. He was the vice-presidential candidate on a ticket with Winston Tubman, who lost to her six years later.  Officials from both Weah and Boakai s campaigns said they would accept the result.  We are disappointed that there is going to be a run off. We had anticipated that we would win in the first round. But we will accept it and go with it,  said Mohammed Ali, spokesman for Boakai s ruling Unity Party. Even before Sunday s results announcement, both campaigns had already begun courting other candidates, seeking their support in the run-off. Ali confirmed that Boakai s campaign had met with fourth placed candidate Alexander Cummings and ex-warlord-turned-senator Prince Johnson, who was in fifth place. Johnson said he had also been contacted by Weah. Brumskine has denounced the vote, claiming it was plagued by fraud and called for a new election though international observers gave the poll a clean bill of health.  The vote will be re-run in two polling places in Nimba County on Tuesday, however, due to irregularities, although that measure only concerns a few thousand votes.

Turkish forces set up positions in Syria's Idlib,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey s military has begun setting up observation posts in northwest Syria s Idlib province, its General Staff said on Friday, part of a deployment that appears partly aimed at containing a Kurdish militia.  Turkey sent a convoy of about 30 military vehicles into rebel-held northwest Syria through the Bab al-Hawa crossing in Idlib, rebels and a witness said.  Video distributed by the Turkish army showed what it said was the convoy starting to move on Thursday night, with military vehicles traveling along a road in darkness.  Turkey says its operation, along with Syrian rebel groups it backs, is part of a deal it reached last month with Russia and Iran in Astana, Kazakhstan, to reduce fighting between insurgents and the Syrian government.  The army said its forces in Syria were conducting operations in line with rules of engagement agreed with Russia and Iran.  However, the deployment is also intended to rein in the Kurdish YPG militia, which holds the adjacent Afrin region, a senior rebel official involved in the operation said.   (It is) in line with Astana 6 resolutions to ensure the area is protected from Russian and regime bombing and to foil any attempt by the separatist YPG militias to illegally seize any territory,  said Mustafa Sejari, an official in a Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group.  Broadcaster CNN Turk reported on its website that there was a clash in Idlib countryside near the Ogulpinar border post in Turkey s Reyhanli district.  It said the sound of  doshka  (machine-gun) fire from across the border could be heard in Reyhanli district and it was not clear which forces were clashing. The convoy was heading toward Sheikh Barakat, a high area overlooking rebel-held territory and the Kurdish YPG-controlled canton of Afrin, the witnesses said.   President Tayyip Erdogan announced the deployment on Saturday, saying Turkey was conducting a  serious operation  with rebel groups it supports. Turkey has supported rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout the war. But since last year Ankara has focused on securing its border, both from jihadists and from Kurdish forces that control much of the frontier area inside Syria.  Sejari, the rebel official, said it was important to contain the YPG to prevent any new military offensive to reach the Mediterranean, something that would require it to capture swathes of mountains held by rebels and Syria s army.  Today we can say that the dream of the separatists to reach the sea and enter Idlib and then to Jisr al-Shaqour and the coastal mountains has become a dream,  he said  Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish group inside Turkey that has been waging armed insurgency against Ankara for three decades.   We said we may come unannounced one night, and tonight our armed forces started the operation in Idlib with the Free Syrian Army,  Erdogan said in a speech to his AK Party on Friday.   We are the ones with the 911 km border with Syria, the ones who are constantly under threat,  he added, noting the YPG s presence in Afrin.  As the strongest part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the YPG has received military aid from Turkey s NATO ally the United States to fight Islamic State.  Last year, Turkey launched the Euphrates Shield operation, an incursion into northern Syria alongside Syrian rebel groups to take territory on the frontier from Islamic State.  That operation was also aimed at stopping the YPG using its own advances against IS from linking Afrin with the much larger area it controls in northeastern Syria.  In the area taken by the Euphrates Shield campaign, Turkey has made changes to local governance that indicate it may be laying a foundation for long term ties with that part of Syria. The Astana agreement with Assad s foreign allies Russia and Iran involves reducing fighting in several regions of Syria, including Idlib and adjacent swathes of the northwest, the most populous rebel-held area.

"Yazidis caught in 'political football' between Baghdad, Iraqi Kurds","SINJAR, Iraq (Reuters) - Since Iraqi forces pushed the Kurds out of the Yazidis   mountainous heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in October, residents are wondering what could happen to them next. Food and money are in short supply since aid organizations stopped delivery after Iraq s advance. Buildings collapsed in the fighting and of those still standing, many are marked with bullets and littered with IEDs. Water and electricity barely work. The Yazidis, whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions, have long been viewed with suspicion and repeatedly persecuted by other groups in Iraq. In 2014, more than 3,000 were killed by Islamic State militants in a campaign described by the United Nations as genocidal. Now the land they have lived on for centuries is caught up in a tug of war between Baghdad and Iraq s Kurds, who had controlled it since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  We re trapped in this game of political football, between Iraq and the Kurds,  said a Yazidi resident of Sinjar, Kamal Ali.  But neither of them cares about our future.  The militias have hoisted Iraq s tricolor flag over government buildings and any remaining Kurdish flags have been scrawled over with the words  Iraq  and  Allahu Akbar , the blazing sun at its center scribbled over in black marker. Sinjar is politically important because it s in the disputed territories, ethnically mixed areas across northern Iraq, long the subject of a constitutional dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds, who both claim them. Sinjar fell under the Kurds  control, despite lying outside Iraqi Kurdistan s recognized borders. Baghdad did little to challenge the arrangement until its October offensive, launched to punish the Kurds for their Sept. 25 independence referendum. Iraqi forces have seized the disputed areas the Kurds had expanded into including Sinjar. The referendum reignited long-simmering tensions over geographic dominance in the oil-rich north, between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), who fought side by side to defeat Islamic State.  The Yazidis are divided about what should happen now. Some are glad the Kurds have gone and see an opportunity for increased autonomy now that they are under federal control following the offensive by Iraq s security forces last October. Kurdish forces handed over Sinjar without a fight to the Lalesh Brigades, a Yazidi militia backed by Baghdad s Shiite paramilitary forces (PMF). Most Yazidis speak a Kurdish dialect, but many don t see themselves as ethnically Kurdish.  We re happy the Kurds have left,  said Abu Sardar, a 47-year-old Yazidi man.  We re Yazidis we re not Kurds, we do not want to be part of Kurdistan.   Like others, Abu Sardar complained that the Kurds forced him to vote in the Kurdish referendum, accusations the KRG denies.  He returned two months ago to the ruins of his home in the Sinuni district of Sinjar and expressed bitter disappointment that little had changed since he left in 2014: hospitals and schools remain shuttered while the city is still mostly rubble.  He hopes that Baghdad and its militias will rebuild Sinjar. Others lament the Kurds  departure. The KRG and allied Yazidi groups hold former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responsible for the campaign by Islamic State. They say his troops  desertion of Mosul allowed militants to capture billions of dollars in weapons later used to attack the minority.  Yazidi commander Qassem Shesho says Iraq s government is too sectarian and dislikes the Yazidis as much as Islamic State. Like many others, he blames the Kurds for the attack by Islamic State.  But they re all we ve got,  he said.     Shesho is allied to Iraqi Kurdistan s ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party, even though the Kurds cut his fighters  salaries after the Lalesh Brigades took over Sinjar. Some days, residents say, there are only bones in Sinjar. Nearly 50 mass graves have been uncovered outside the town since 2014.  Sinjar is a city of ghosts,  said the Lalesh Brigades  leader Ali Serhan Eissa, also known as Khal Ali. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled the militant onslaught and headed for Mount Sinjar. Of those who didn t reach the mountain, about 3,100 were killed   with more than half shot, beheaded, burned alive and disposed of in mass graves. Others were sold into sexual slavery or forced to fight, according to a report by the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine. Some are still on the mountain, about to spend a third freezing winter in tents.   Before the attack, Sinjar was home to about 400,000 people   mainly Yazidis and Arab Sunnis. Only 15 percent of Yazidis have returned home, according to humanitarian estimates.  Most Yazidis remain in IDP camps in the Kurdistan region, along with most of the area s displace Sunnis. Aid workers worry the camps will be closed if tensions between Baghdad and the Kurds flare up.  The presence of fighters from Turkey s separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) further complicates the picture. Many Yazidis credit them with opening up a land route to allow those stranded on Mount Sinjar to escape the militants in 2014. The PKK entrenched itself in the community, even creating a local unit, the Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS) which controls multiple checkpoints around Sinjar. Turkey and neighboring Iran are closely watching the power shift in Sinjar. Tehran wants to secure this north-western region of Iraq as it sits on the border with Syria, while Turkey wants the region free of the outlawed PKK.

Top Trump lieutenant Scaramucci lashes colleagues in obscene rant," (Note: Strong language in paragraph 3) By Steve Holland WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Open warfare erupted inside President Donald Trumpâs inner circle as his new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, attacked senior White House colleagues in obscene comments published on Thursday. Scaramucci blasted White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trumpâs chief strategist, Steve Bannon, in an article in The New Yorker based on a telephone conversation on Wednesday night between one of the magazineâs correspondents and Scaramucci. Amid a stream of vulgar language, the former Wall Street financier named to the communications post last Friday called Priebus a âfucking paranoid schizophrenicâ and accused Bannon of trying to build his own brand âoff the fucking strength of the president.â In a Twitter message after the article appeared online, Scaramucci said: âI sometimes use colorful language. I will  refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrumpâs agenda.â Asked about the article, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration was focused on healthcare and other items. âHe used some colorful language that I donât anticipate heâll do again,â she told reporters. Any apology âneeds to happen personally between them,â she said. Priebus and Bannon had no comment. Trump himself made no public comment on his aideâs outburst.   Some of Trumpâs advisers have questioned Priebusâ competence and his position appeared weak. Republicans close to the White House said Trumpâs family had also been critical of his chief of staff. The drama was the latest sign of disarray within the Trump White House even as it tries to advance healthcare and tax reform legislation. The president himself is preoccupied with an investigation into Russian meddling in last yearâs presidential election and has been fiercely critical in recent days of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The scathing remarks by Scaramucci came as he and other Trump loyalists ratcheted up pressure on Priebus, a former Republican National Committee chairman, who does not have years-long ties with Trump.  There has been speculation that Priebus, who steered the party apparatus behind Trumpâs unorthodox candidacy in last yearâs election, is on his way out because Trump has no major legislative achievements in his first six months in office. Earlier in the day, Sanders would not say whether Trump had confidence in Priebus.  âWe all serve at the pleasure of the president and if it gets to a place where that isnât the place, heâll let you know,â Sanders told reporters. She added that Trump âhires the very best peopleâ who are not always going to agree and that he supports âhealthy competition, and with that competition you usually get the best results.â Priebus had sought to block Scaramucci from a White House job, according to officials. Priebusâ allies said Trumpâs hiring of Scaramucci, which prompted press secretary Sean Spicer to resign, was a bad omen for Priebus. In The New Yorker article, Scaramucci demanded to know how the reporter found out about a White House dinner Scaramucci had with Trump on Wednesday. In the conversation, Scaramucci made clear he suspected that Priebus had leaked the information to the reporter, calling Priebus âa paranoiac,â according to the magazine. Scaramucci also told The New Yorker that unlike Bannon, he had no interest in media attention. âIâm not Steve Bannon,â he said, adding: âIâm here to serve the country.â On Wednesday, Scaramucci appeared to suggest in a Twitter message, later deleted, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation should investigate Priebus over a leak of Scaramucciâs financial records. âIf Reince wants to explain heâs not a leaker, let him do that,â Scaramucci said on CNNâs âNew Dayâ on Thursday. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan defended Priebus on Thursday. The two men, both from Wisconsin, are close. âReince is doing a fantastic job at the White House and I believe he has the presidentâs confidence. If those two gentlemen have differences, my advice would be to sit down and settle your differences,â Ryan told a news conference. Trump allies saw the drama playing out as a sign that the group of original Trump supporters was growing weary of Priebus and the RNC faction he brought with him. âThere is a widespread feeling among Trump supporters that heâs never been a real supporter of Donald Trump and that he isnât playing to win on the presidentâs behalf,â said an outside Trump adviser. âAfter six months of this, time is up.â ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2017 ",0,note strong language paragraph 3 steve holland washington reuters open warfare erupted inside president donald trump inner circle new communication director anthony scaramucci attacked senior white house colleague obscene comment published thursday scaramucci blasted white house chief staff reince priebus trump chief strategist steve bannon article new yorker based telephone conversation wednesday night one magazine correspondent scaramucci amid stream vulgar language former wall street financier named communication post last friday called priebus fucking paranoid schizophrenic accused bannon trying build brand fucking strength president twitter message article appeared online scaramucci said sometimes use colorful language refrain arena give passionate fight realdonaldtrump agenda asked article white house press secretary sarah sander said administration focused healthcare item used colorful language anticipate told reporter apology need happen personally said priebus bannon comment trump made public comment aide outburst trump adviser questioned priebus competence position appeared weak republican close white house said trump family also critical chief staff drama latest sign disarray within trump white house even try advance healthcare tax reform legislation president preoccupied investigation russian meddling last year presidential election fiercely critical recent day attorney general jeff session scathing remark scaramucci came trump loyalist ratcheted pressure priebus former republican national committee chairman year long tie trump speculation priebus steered party apparatus behind trump unorthodox candidacy last year election way trump major legislative achievement first six month office earlier day sander would say whether trump confidence priebus serve pleasure president get place place let know sander told reporter added trump hire best people always going agree support healthy competition competition usually get best result priebus sought block scaramucci white house job according official priebus ally said trump hiring scaramucci prompted press secretary sean spicer resign bad omen priebus new yorker article scaramucci demanded know reporter found white house dinner scaramucci trump wednesday conversation scaramucci made clear suspected priebus leaked information reporter calling priebus paranoiac according magazine scaramucci also told new yorker unlike bannon interest medium attention steve bannon said adding serve country wednesday scaramucci appeared suggest twitter message later deleted federal bureau investigation investigate priebus leak scaramucci financial record reince want explain leaker let scaramucci said cnn new day thursday u house representative speaker paul ryan defended priebus thursday two men wisconsin close reince fantastic job white house believe president confidence two gentleman difference advice would sit settle difference ryan told news conference trump ally saw drama playing sign group original trump supporter growing weary priebus rnc faction brought widespread feeling among trump supporter never real supporter donald trump playing win president behalf said outside trump adviser six month time,426,3192
"Clinton, Sanders both say they can beat Trump during feisty Michigan debate","FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred in a debate on Sunday over who had the best chance to beat Republican front-runner Donald Trump, and mocked the level of discourse in the Republican White House race. Near the end of a Michigan debate that featured sharp clashes over trade and the auto industry bailout, as well as a lengthy discussion of religion, Clinton and Sanders both said they could not wait to face the brash billionaire in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. âI think Donald Trumpâs bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear well on the American people,â Clinton said. âWe have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.â Sanders said he would âloveâ to run against Trump and noted many opinion polls showed him faring better against him than Clinton did. He and Clinton urged voters to compare the substance of their debate with the Republican versions, which last week featured name-calling and Trump defending his penis size. âWe are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money in mental health,â Sanders said, then cracked a joke. âAnd when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in mental health.â Trump frequently says he will beat either Clinton or Sanders. âI am the one person that she does not want to run against,â he said of Clinton on Saturday.  The debate in Flint, which is suffering a water contamination and public health crisis, came as Sanders has struggled to slow Clintonâs march to the presidential nomination. Sanders picked up some good news on Sunday with a projected win in Maineâs caucus. Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state and first lady,  has spoken on the campaign trail of the need for more love and kindness, a contrast to Trumpâs rhetoric about his plans to deport illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. âI donât intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights,â Clinton said in the debate. Describing herself as a âpraying person,â she said it was hard to imagine living under the pressure of the White House âwithout being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.â Sanders, asked if he was deliberately keeping his Jewish faith in the background on the campaign trail, said his fatherâs family was wiped out in the Holocaust. He described going shopping with his mother as a boy in Brooklyn, New York, and seeing people with numbers on their arms from Nazi concentration camps. âI am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being,â Sanders said. Earlier, the two candidates exchanged angry jabs over trade, with Sanders accusing Clinton of backing âdisastrousâ trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs out of cities like Flint and Detroit and shifted them overseas. But Clinton said Sandersâ opposition to the 2009 auto bailout, a crucial issue in a state that is home to the U.S. auto industry, would have cost millions of jobs. The bailout, which Clinton supported, passed Congress and has been credited with helping save the U.S. industry. Sanders, 74 a U.S. senator from Vermont and democratic socialist, also questioned the sincerity of Clintonâs conversion to opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal. The two contenders cut each other off on several occasions, a rare occurrence in a race that has been much more polite than the raucous Republican presidential campaign. âExcuse me, Iâm talking,â Sanders said to Clinton when she tried to interrupt. âIf youâre going to talk, tell the whole story,â Clinton responded. Sanders pressed his charge that Clinton was too close to Wall Street and demanded again that she release the transcript of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms. Clinton said she would release them when all the candidates, including Republicans, also release transcripts of similar talks. Throwing up his hands, Sanders said: âIâll release it. Here it is. There ainât nothing! I donât give speeches to Wall Street!â The debate was held in Flint to highlight the cityâs water contamination crisis, and both candidates expressed outrage at Flintâs plight and demanded Republican Governor Rick Snyderâs resignation. The crisis in Flint, a predominantly black city of 100,000, was triggered when an emergency city manager installed by Snyder switched the cityâs water supply to the nearby Flint River from Lake Michigan to save money. The change corroded Flintâs aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply, exposing thousands of residents including children to high lead levels that have sparked serious health problems.

Battle over N.C. transgender law intensifies as lawmakers reconvene,"RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of people flocked to North Carolinaâs capital on Monday to show both support and disdain for a law that has thrust the state into the international spotlight over its restrictions on transgender bathroom access and gay rights. Lawmakers returned to Raleigh to begin a short session  designed to address the state budget. But controversy over the new law, which has drawn reaction from U.S. presidential candidates, U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron among others, is expected to dominate. The measure puts the state at the center of a debate over equality, privacy and religious freedom as states propose legislation seen as discriminatory against gay and transgender people in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court last year ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. North Carolina became the first U.S. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.  Fifty-four people were arrested at the Legislative Building as they protested against the law on Monday, General Assembly police Officer Scott Cameron said. âOur state is a state of crisis,â Chris Sgro, executive director of the Equality North Carolina advocacy group, said earlier in the day before activists delivered petitions to Republican Governor Pat McCroryâs office demanding the lawâs repeal. A group of Democratic representatives filed a bill seeking a repeal. But leading Republican lawmakers in the state have shown little willingness to back down, and they were greeted at a rally on Monday by thousands of people who came on church buses and held signs thanking them for the measure. Business leaders, entertainers and politicians including Obama and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump have come out against the law. Opponents contend it demonizes transgender people and limits government protections against discrimination for gays and lesbians.  Supporters including social conservatives and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz say it is needed to protect women and children from sexual predators in bathrooms. On Monday, singers Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas joined a growing list of entertainers who have canceled shows in the state. Lovato wrote on Twitter that she and Jonas were protesting âthis hateful law.â As part of the backlash, companies and associations have relocated conventions and halted job-creating investment projects initially slated for North Carolina.  Republican State Representative Paul Stam criticized companies, including PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O), that have pulled jobs out of North Carolina over the measure. âThey have offices in countries where homosexuals are executed,â he said. âThe hypocrisy of those who oppose this bill is amazing.â ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",0,raleigh n c reuters thousand people flocked north carolina capital monday show support disdain law thrust state international spotlight restriction transgender bathroom access gay right lawmaker returned raleigh begin short session designed address state budget controversy new law drawn reaction u presidential candidate u president barack obama british prime minister david cameron among others expected dominate measure put state center debate equality privacy religious freedom state propose legislation seen discriminatory gay transgender people wake u supreme court last year ruling legalized sex marriage north carolina became first u state require transgender people use restroom public building school match sex birth certificate rather gender identity fifty four people arrested legislative building protested law monday general assembly police officer scott cameron said state state crisis chris sgro executive director equality north carolina advocacy group said earlier day activist delivered petition republican governor pat mccrory office demanding law repeal group democratic representative filed bill seeking repeal leading republican lawmaker state shown little willingness back greeted rally monday thousand people came church bus held sign thanking measure business leader entertainer politician including obama republican presidential front runner donald trump come law opponent contend demonizes transgender people limit government protection discrimination gay lesbian supporter including social conservative republican presidential candidate ted cruz say needed protect woman child sexual predator bathroom monday singer demi lovato nick jonas joined growing list entertainer canceled show state lovato wrote twitter jonas protesting hateful law part backlash company association relocated convention halted job creating investment project initially slated north carolina republican state representative paul stam criticized company including paypal holding pypl pulled job north carolina measure office country homosexual executed said hypocrisy oppose bill amazing,275,2090

"For Obama, setbacks from a divided Supreme Court","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court breaks for the summer this week, having dealt high-profile setbacks to President Barack Obama on issues important to his liberal legacy, notably on immigration and climate change. This will be the high courtâs last full nine-month term of the Democratic presidentâs administration. Obama leaves office in January 2017. The court was one shy of its full strength nine members much of this term due to the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13. His absence affected the outcome of some major cases. Four cases, including the immigration dispute, ended in 4-4 splits that left lower court rulings in place. There was little Obama could do about it. Even if the Republican-led U.S. Senate had accepted Obamaâs March 16 nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia, it was unlikely he would have made it to the bench in time to hear the termâs final round of arguments in April. Hoping their candidate wins the presidential election in November, Republicans insist the choice of Scaliaâs successor should fall to the next president. The administration did score some major wins on abortion and  other social issues, but these were when it intervened in cases where it was not directly involved. Obamaâs biggest loss came last Thursday on his bid to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation. The 4-4 deadlock will keep him from taking major action on immigration reform, a top policy aim, before he leaves office. In a second major blow to Obamaâs legacy, the court unexpectedly put on hold sweeping federal regulations meant to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the centerpiece of his administrationâs climate change strategy.. That decision by a 5-4 vote, days before Scaliaâs death, effectively put off a ruling on the regulation until after a legal challenge is completed - sometime after the next president enters the White House - and prevented the new regulations from being implemented. On healthcare, the administration lost narrowly to Christian groups that sought an exemption to a provision of his signature law known as Obamacare requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception.  The high court sent that dispute back to lower courts without deciding the main legal issue, throwing out a series of rulings in the governmentâs favor. The administration lost some other big cases in which it was directly involved, including former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnellâs successful appeal of his corruption convictions. A silver lining for the administration came in cases where it lent its support, as a friend of the court, to advocates for abortion rights and for race-based university admissions to offset years of discrimination. Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the administrationâs top Supreme Court lawyer until he stepped down last week, deserved some credit for the ruling on Monday striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas due to his performance during the oral argument. Last Thursday, the court upheld consideration of race as an acceptable factor in admissions at the University of Texas. Had Scalia lived, the court might have deadlocked 4-4 in that too. One 4-4 decision went the administrationâs way. The government supported unions that successfully fended off a conservative legal challenge. The divided court left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the unions. With Scalia on the court, the conservative majority would likely have struck down fees that many states force workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities.

"Despite healthcare setback, Trump says big surprise on bill could come","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite a major setback in the U.S. Senate, President Trump said on Wednesday that the Republican healthcare bill was moving along well and predicted a âsurpriseâ was yet to come. In a big hit to a seven-year quest to undo Democratic former President Barack Obamaâs signature legislative achievement, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to get the bill passed this week. Trump, who met with Republican senators on Tuesday, made his optimistic comments to reporters at the White House on Wednesday while meeting with players from the World Series-winning Chicago Cubs. âWeâre going to have a great, great surprise,â he said. Trump later said he did not think U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was serious when asking for a meeting for all 100 U.S. senators to negotiate healthcare changes. âI donât think heâs serious. He hasnât been serious. Obamacare is such a disaster. And he wants to try and save something thatâs hurting a lot of people,â Trump said. Trump promised as a presidential candidate to do away with Obamaâs Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Republicans would like to make progress on that issue to clear the way for other priorities such as tax reform.

North Korea says seeking military 'equilibrium' with U.S.,"SEOUL/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday it aims to reach an  equilibrium  of military force with the United States, which earlier signaled its patience for diplomacy is wearing thin after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in under a month.  Our final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military option,  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying by the state news agency, KCNA. Kim was shown beaming as he watched the missile fly from a moving launcher in photos released by the agency, surrounded by several officials.  The combat efficiency and reliability of Hwasong-12 were thoroughly verified,  said Kim as quoted by KCNA. Kim added the North s goal of completing its nuclear force had  nearly reached the terminal . North Korea has launched dozens of missiles under Kim s leadership as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it the ability to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile.     After the latest missile launch on Friday, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States was fast running out of patience with North Korea s missile and nuclear programs.  We ve been kicking the can down the road, and we re out of road,  McMaster told reporters, referring to Pyongyang s repeated missile tests in defiance of international pressure.  For those ... who have been commenting on a lack of a military option, there is a military option,  he said, adding that it would not be the Trump administration s preferred choice. Also on Friday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the  highly provocative  missile launch by North Korea. It had already stepped up sanctions against North Korea in response to a nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, imposing a ban on North Korea s textile exports and capping its imports of crude oil. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, echoed McMaster s strong rhetoric, even as she said Washington s preferred resolution to the crisis is through diplomacy and sanctions.  What we are seeing is, they are continuing to be provocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that point there s not a whole lot the Security Council is going to be able to do from here, when you ve cut 90 percent of the trade and 30 percent of the oil,  Haley said. U.S. President Donald Trump said that he is  more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming.  He said at Joint Base Andrews near Washington that North Korea  has once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbors and for the entire world community.  North Korea s latest test missile flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan on Friday and landed in the Pacific about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) to the east, the Japanese government said. It traveled about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) in total, according to South Korea s military, far enough to reach the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which the North has threatened before.  The range of this test was significant since North Korea demonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile,  the Union of Concerned Scientists advocacy group said in a statement. However, the accuracy of the missile, still at an early stage of development, was low, it said. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson called on China, Pyongyang s only ally, and Russia to apply more pressure on North Korea by  taking direct actions of their own.  Beijing has pushed back, urging Washington to do more to rein in North Korea.  Honestly, I think the United States should be doing .. much more than now, so that there s real effective international cooperation on this issue,  China s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said on Friday.  They should refrain from issuing more threats. They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation,  he said, while adding that China would never accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state. North Korea staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test earlier this month and in July tested long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching at least parts of the U.S. mainland. Last month, North Korea fired an intermediate range missile that also flew over Hokkaido into the ocean. Warning announcements about the latest missile blared in parts of northern Japan, while many residents received alerts on their mobile phones or saw warnings on TV telling them to seek refuge. The U.S. military said it had detected a single intermediate range ballistic missile but it did not pose a threat to North America or Guam. Global equities investors largely shrugged off the latest missile test by North Korea as shares on Wall Street set new highs on Friday. Trump has promised not to allow North Korea to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. Russia s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the United States needed to begin talks with North Korea, something that Washington has so far ruled out.  We called on our U.S. partners and others to implement political and diplomatic solutions that are provided for in the resolution,  Nebenzia told reporters after the Security Council meeting.  Without implementing this, we also will consider it as a non-compliance with the resolution.  Asked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House spokesman said,  As the president and his national security team have repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North Korea.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with the North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to analyze and prepare for possible new North Korean threats, including electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.

Macron lawmakers admonished for partying in French parliament,"PARIS (Reuters) - The head of France s parliament on Tuesday admonished newcomers from President Emmanuel Macron s party for noisy partying in the assembly s bar after late-night sessions. In one such case, lawmakers from the centrist president s Republic on The Move (LREM) party improvised a party with music at the National Assembly s bar after a debate on the social security budget. The bar staff were obliged to work late until the lawmakers had left, parliamentary sources said. Macron s 313 lawmakers, many of whom are new to politics, were initially criticized after the June election for their inexperience, though this has not stopped the swift adoption of wide-ranging reforms, including security and labor laws. But the partying after late-night votes has to stop, the assembly s president Francois de Rugy told them on Tuesday, saying it was not fair on the staff who work there.  De Rugy also said lawmakers must stop brandishing objects in parliament, something its rules and regulations forbid. That remark appeared aimed at lawmakers from the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who in July piled up pasta and a pot of tomato sauce on their bench in parliament to show how much students would lose out on with a 5 euro cut in housing subsidies.  It is crucial that the presidents of (parliamentary) groups remind each and every member about the proper conduct of parliamentary proceedings and the necessary dignity of lawmakers,  de Rugy said in a statement.

ALABAMA: MIDDLE CLASS WHITE WOMAN Rejected For Jobs In City Filled ILLEGAL Immigrantsâ¦âI canât find a job because I donât speak Spanishâ,"Democrats don t care if this legal immigrant has a job. Making America work again is not something they have very much interest in addressing. What s most important to them is how the illegal immigrants they have welcomed into our country with open arms will vote There s one question Sandra Langlois is sick of hearing in job interviews. Do you speak Spanish? Langlois doesn t   and doesn t think she should have to.At 42, she already speaks two languages. Born in Germany, she moved to Pennsylvania as a child and learned to speak English fluently. She thought that would be enough to get a job in the United States.Now, as she waits for an interview at the Albertville unemployment office, she s not sure it will be.Hispanic immigrants, she says, have transformed the state she s called home for decades. And the ones who came to the United States illegally, she says, make a tough job market even tougher.Langlois needs to find work, and fast: Her family is living in a motel after the power company turned out the lights in their trailer. She s sharing a car and cell phone with her father-in-law.The Spanish question, she says, has abruptly ended more than one interview. She hopes it won t throw her out of the running this time, too. It s kind of, really, discrimination,  she says.  If you re not here legally, then you need to go ahead and go back home.   They need to come over here the right way. Don t sneak over. Don t stay here. It s a sentiment that runs deep through some circles of this largely white, working-class town, which made headlines as the epicenter of Alabama s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. Five years later, people in Albertville are still split over the changes they ve seen   and what they think should happen next.So is the country.A CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll (PDF) released this week reveals deep divides across the United States on immigration.Working-class whites   a group some analysts say could play a decisive role in the presidential election   are far more likely than others to say immigrants who arrived illegally should be deported. More than half (55%) say that s something the government should attempt, compared with 27% of white college grads.Those statistics don t surprise Glenda Barnes. The 70-year-old Albertville resident says she moved out of her neighborhood when immigrants started moving in. Her street started to go downhill, she says, as people crammed cars onto lawns and stopped taking care of homes. If you lived here, you d understand,  she says.  Our town was so neat, a nice little town. Now it s like we don t care, and everything s falling in. Rachel Zavaleta isn t surprised by the numbers either. The 29-year-old still remembers what people shouted at her on the playground when she came to Albertville with her family nearly 20 years ago: Go back to Mexico.A changing landscapeDebates about deporting immigrants who came here illegally aren t just political talking points in Albertville; they re personal.This is a city where officials tried hard to force them out, in a state where lawmakers passed the toughest law in the country aimed at doing the same thing.Five years later, even people who don t see eye to eye on immigration can agree on one thing: It didn t work.Albertville proudly bills itself as  the Fire Hydrant Capital of the World,  for the Mueller factory that s manufactured millions there. But across the state, it s better known for another industry: poultry processing plants, which employ thousands of workers   many of them immigrants.More than a quarter of the town s roughly 22,000 residents are Hispanic. And Alabama s 2011 immigration law scared many people who d found jobs in the area.Terrified they d be rounded up and deported, they abandoned homes, pulled their kids out of school and moved to other states. Neighborhoods were left nearly empty. Shopping districts became ghost towns.But in 2012, a federal appeals court gutted much of the law, ruling that parts of it were unconstitutional, including a requirement that public schools determine the immigration status of students and parents.Now, Albertville s Latino immigrant population is thriving once again. A growing number of Haitian refugees, recruited by chicken plants in recent years, have moved to the city, too.The large Catholic church where thousands pray in Spanish every Sunday just paid off its new $1.2 million building, thanks to donations from the congregation.Eateries serving tacos and tamales are easier to find in some parts of the city than restaurants offering grits or fried catfish.The relationships between residents   and the approaches local leaders take   have changed.But it doesn t take long to see that tensions are still simmering.Stop by the basketball court where Mexican workers are shooting hoops, and you ll hear how afraid they are that Donald Trump might be president, and what it was like a few years back when people couldn t get water or electricity in their homes unless they could prove they were here legally.Sit for a moment in the Little League stands nearby, and a woman flipping through a coupon book as she leans back in a lawn chair will tell you how immigrants should stop speaking Spanish and sucking benefits from the system.Step into a shopping mall off the busy four-lane highway through town, and you ll see immigrants searching for the right words in an English class as they talk with their teacher about what foods to eat on American holidays and how fast the cashiers speak at Walmart.Cross the parking lot to visit the unemployment office, and you ll hear some people say the influx of immigrants gave the region s economy a boost, while others grumble it cost them their jobs. There s plenty of jobs Langlois runs her fingers through her hair as she scans the bulletin board at the unemployment office, looking for a lead.Could she be a dishwasher or a welder? Will she go back to working at a chicken plant? Is there any other choice?As an immigrant herself, Langlois says she s had to follow strict rules and make sure her documents are in order when she applies for jobs. And she resents immigrants who came to the United States illegally for finding ways to skirt the system. It s just not fair,  she says.  It s like they re getting special treatment. The CNN/KFF poll found that working-class whites were significantly more likely than other groups to say illegal immigration had directly affected them.More than a quarter (27%) say their family has been negatively affected by undocumented immigrants taking jobs in their community, and among this group, 8 in 10 want the government to deport all undocumented immigrants.The trend is even stronger in the South.

 Trump Declares That He Unanimously âWONâ The Third Debate And The Internet LAUGHS At Him,"Grab your popcorn and sit down because Trump just posted a tweet that proves how delusional he really is.It s been two days since the third presidential debate, and Donald Trump s campaign continues to roll downhill in flames like a rickety gasoline-soaked wagon on fire.But Donald Trump, in yet another lie to his supporters, actually claimed on Twitter that he won the debate by a  unanimous  decision. The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON!  Trump wrote.  Thank you, these are very exciting times. The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2016Apparently, Donald Trump is confused about what winning actually looks like.Because not only did most reaction polls indicate that Hillary Clinton won the debate, the scientific polls indicate she won as well.A CBS News poll found that 49 percent of debate watchers surveyed said Clinton won, which is 10 points higher than the 39 percent who say Trump won.Similarly, Clinton was declared the winner 46 percent to 37 percent of those surveyed by an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll.Also, the CNN/ORC poll found that Clinton won the debate as well, with 52 percent saying Hillary won versus only 39 percent who said Trump won.And that s not all. Hillary also beat the hell out of Trump in a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll by 17 points, 43 percent to 26 percent.In other words, Trump LOST the debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas just as he lost the first two.Twitter users certainly think Trump s declaration of victory is a joke.

 Scholastic Yanks Childrenâs Book For Its Portrayal Of Happy Slaves (IMAGE),"On Sunday, publishing company Scholastic announced that it would be removing A Birthday Cake for George Washington from shelves over criticism that the book portrayed happy slaves.In a press release, Scholastic explained that the book needed to include more context on the  evils of slavery  and that all returns would be honored. The statement read: While we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author, illustrator and editor, we believe that, without more historical background on the evils of slavery than this book for younger children can provide, the book may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves and therefore should be withdrawn. We do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children, despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author, editor, and illustrator. The book, which was released on January 5th, happens to be about an enslaved man and his daughter faced with the task of baking President George Washington a birthday cake. Here s the cover:Scholastic s description of the story reads: Oh, how George Washington loves his cake! And, oh, how he depends on Hercules, his head chef, to make it for him. Hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president s cake. But this year there is one problem   they are out of sugar. Scholastic s reaction is a complete turnaround from its previous defense of the book, which claimed the topic of slavery had been approached with the  utmost care.  Scholastic also previously claimed the book depicted the slaves being happy because they were living in  near-freedom  and simply enjoyed cooking. Scholastic even allowed the book s author, Ramin Ganeshram, to explain the intention behind the book on the publisher s blog last week as public outcry increased. Graneshram insisted that his story was based on historical research and was meant as a compliment to the slaves  resiliency and resourcefulness. Graneshram wrote: How could they smile? How could they be anything but unrelentingly miserable?  Ganeshram wrote.  How could they be proud to bake a cake for George Washington? The answers to those questions are complex because human nature is complex. Bizarrely and yes, disturbingly, there were some enslaved people who had a better quality of life than others and  close  relationships with those who enslaved them. But they were smart enough to use those  advantages  to improve their lives. Even before Scholastic made its decision to pull it, the book had over 100 one-star reviews on Amazon. At the time the announcement was made, only 12 of those reviews were positive.School Library Journal called the book  highly problematic,  advising people not to buy it. Kirkus Reviews, another trade publication, said the book was  an incomplete, even dishonest treatment of slavery.

 Watch Trump Call Reporter A âSleazeâ For Having The Audacity To Report Facts,"How does the old saying go? The more unapologetically defensive you appear, the more guilty you probably are   or something like that. That at least seems to be the case with Donald Trump any time he is scrutinized on, well, pretty much anything. However, when it comes to his claim that he s raised money for veterans, even though many are saying he s grossly exaggerating the amount, he really doesn t like being called out on the discrepancy.During a press conference on Tuesday, Trump was asked by ABC s Tom Llamas: Mr. Trump, writing a one million dollar check is incredibly generous, but the night of that Iowa fundraiser you said you had raised $6 million. Clearly you had not. Your critics say you tend to exaggerate, you have a problem with the truth. Is this a prime example? Trump responded: No, I raised almost $6 million. Some of it didn t come through, but more money is coming through. The number is probably is going to be when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million. Trump then proceeds to blast the media, and then at one point called out Llamas directly, even calling him a  sleaze  for having the audacity to point out facts. Trump said: But what I don t want is when I raise millions of dollars, have people say, like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC. He s a sleaze in my book. You re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well. Ironically, Llamas does seem to know the facts well, and Trump doesn t like being called out on the fact that he s been exaggerating.Llamas took to Twitter shortly after saying:Trump just called me a ""sleaze."" Should be an interesting week.  Tom Llamas (@TomLlamasABC) May 31, 2016What sort of person running for leader of the free world behaves like this? Trump is completely thin-skinned and bullies anyone who dare question him. If he can t handle being scrutinized, how the hell is he going to lead the nation, or for that matter, work in our diplomatic world interests across the globe. Truth is, he wouldn t be able to.

WHOA! NEW EMAILS SHOW COMEY FBI LIED About Meeting Between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch On Tarmacâ¦Proves Media Colluded With Obamaâs DOJ To Kill Story About Tarmac Meeting [VIDEO],"A new email dump from the FBI via a FOIA request by the ACLJ reveals what appears to be collusion between the media and the DOJ to squash the story about the 2016 meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton on the tarmac in Phoenix, AZ.Also Comey reportedly said the FBI had no documents related to this meeting to fill a prior FOIA request. That apparently isn t true, given this new email dump.  The Right ScoopWatch:From the ACLJ: We have just obtained hundreds of pages in our ongoing investigation and federal lawsuit on former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton while the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI had an ongoing criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. The results are shocking.Watch Lynch s explanation of her meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac:First, the Comey FBI lied to us. Last July, we sent FOIA requests to both the Comey FBI and the Lynch DOJ asking for any documents related to the Clinton Lynch plane meeting. The FBI, under the then directorship of James Comey, replied that  No records responsive to your request were located. The documents we received today from the Department of Justice include several emails from the FBI to DOJ officials concerning the meeting. One with the subject line  FLAG  was correspondence between FBI officials (Richard Quinn, FBI Media/Investigative Publicity, and Michael Kortan) and DOJ officials concerning  flag[ing] a story . . . about a casual, unscheduled meeting between former president Bill Clinton and the AG.  The DOJ official instructs the FBI to  let me know if you get any questions about this  and provides  [o]ur talkers [DOJ talking points] on this . The talking points, however are redacted.Another email to the FBI contains the subject line  security details coordinate between Loretta Lynch/Bill Clinton? On July 1, 2016   just days before our FOIA request   a DOJ email chain under the subject line,  FBI just called,  indicates that the  FBI . . . is looking for guidance  in responding to media inquiries about news reports that the FBI had prevented the press from taking pictures of the Clinton Lynch meeting. The discussion then went off email to several phone calls (of which we are not able to obtain records). An hour later, Carolyn Pokomy of the Office of the Attorney General stated,  I will let Rybicki know.  Jim Rybicki was the Chief of Staff and Senior Counselor to FBI Director Jim Comey. The information that was to be provided to Rybicki is redacted.Also of note several of the documents contain redactions that are requested  per FBI. It is clear that there were multiple records within the FBI responsive to our request and that discussions regarding the surreptitious meeting between then AG Lynch and the husband of the subject of an ongoing FBI criminal investigation reached the highest levels of the FBI.However, on October 21, 2016, the Comey FBI replied to our legal demands that  No records responsive to your request were located.  This is in direct contravention to the law, and we are preparing further legal action to force the FBI to come clean and turn over ALL documents related to this matter to us in a timely manner.Second, the hundreds of pages of (heavily redacted   more on that below) documents paint a clear picture of a DOJ in crisis mode as the news broke of Attorney General Lynch s meeting with former President Clinton. In fact, the records appear to indicate that the Attorney General s spin team immediately began preparing talking points for the Attorney General regarding the meeting BEFORE ever speaking with the AG about the matter.Third, there is clear evidence that the main stream media was colluding with the DOJ to bury the story. A Washington Post reporter, speaking of the Clinton Lynch meeting story, said,  I m hoping I can put it to rest .  The same Washington Post reporter, interacting with the DOJ spin team, implemented specific DOJ requests to change his story to make the Attorney General appear in a more favorable light. A New York Times reporter apologetically told the Obama DOJ that he was being  pressed into service  to have to cover the story. As the story was breaking, DOJ press officials stated,  I also talked to the ABC producer, who noted that they aren t interested, even if Fox runs with it. Two days after the meeting, DOJ officials in a chain of emails that includes emails to Attorney General Lynch herself stated that the media coverage of the meeting  looks like all or most are FOX  and that  CBS . . . just says a few lines about the meeting. Fourth, DOJ bureaucrats have redacted all the talking points, discussions of talking points, a statement on the meeting that was apparently never delivered because there was not enough media coverage on the meeting, and its substantive discussions with the FBI on the matter. They absurdly claim the  deliberative process exemption  to FOIA, which is only supposed to apply to agency rulemaking processes.The ACLJ won t stop until justice is served on this matter:Discussions about Attorney General Lynch s ethically questionable meeting with former President Clinton during her investigation into Hillary Clinton clearly has nothing to do with any rule making process. We will be taking these redactions back to federal court. The law is on our side. We will keep pressing on with our investigation of former Attorney General Lynch until we get to the bottom of this.To donate to the ACLJ and help to fund the important work they re doing, click HERE.Here s James Comey discussing the Lynch and Clinton meeting on the tarmac:Here is Loretta Lynch s testimony before Congress regarding her meeting with Bill Clinton:",politics,"Aug 4, 2017",1,new email dump fbi via foia request aclj reveals appears collusion medium doj squash story 2016 meeting loretta lynch bill clinton tarmac phoenix az also comey reportedly said fbi document related meeting fill prior foia request apparently true given new email dump right scoopwatch aclj obtained hundred page ongoing investigation federal lawsuit former attorney general loretta lynch tarmac meeting former president bill clinton department justice doj fbi ongoing criminal investigation hillary clinton email result shocking watch lynch explanation meeting bill clinton tarmac first comey fbi lied u last july sent foia request comey fbi lynch doj asking document related clinton lynch plane meeting fbi directorship james comey replied record responsive request located document received today department justice include several email fbi doj official concerning meeting one subject line flag correspondence fbi official richard quinn fbi medium investigative publicity michael kortan doj official concerning flag ing story casual unscheduled meeting former president bill clinton ag doj official instructs fbi let know get question provides ur talker doj talking point talking point however redacted another email fbi contains subject line security detail coordinate loretta lynch bill clinton july 1 2016 day foia request doj email chain subject line fbi called indicates fbi looking guidance responding medium inquiry news report fbi prevented press taking picture clinton lynch meeting discussion went email several phone call able obtain record hour later carolyn pokomy office attorney general stated let rybicki know jim rybicki chief staff senior counselor fbi director jim comey information provided rybicki redacted also note several document contain redaction requested per fbi clear multiple record within fbi responsive request discussion regarding surreptitious meeting ag lynch husband subject ongoing fbi criminal investigation reached highest level fbi however october 21 2016 comey fbi replied legal demand record responsive request located direct contravention law preparing legal action force fbi come clean turn document related matter u timely manner second hundred page heavily redacted document paint clear picture doj crisis mode news broke attorney general lynch meeting former president clinton fact record appear indicate attorney general spin team immediately began preparing talking point attorney general regarding meeting ever speaking ag matter third clear evidence main stream medium colluding doj bury story washington post reporter speaking clinton lynch meeting story said hoping put rest washington post reporter interacting doj spin team implemented specific doj request change story make attorney general appear favorable light new york time reporter apologetically told obama doj pressed service cover story story breaking doj press official stated also talked abc producer noted interested even fox run two day meeting doj official chain email includes email attorney general lynch stated medium coverage meeting look like fox cbs say line meeting fourth doj bureaucrat redacted talking point discussion talking point statement meeting apparently never delivered enough medium coverage meeting substantive discussion fbi matter absurdly claim deliberative process exemption foia supposed apply agency rulemaking process aclj stop justice served matter discussion attorney general lynch ethically questionable meeting former president clinton investigation hillary clinton clearly nothing rule making process taking redaction back federal court law side keep pressing investigation former attorney general lynch get bottom donate aclj help fund important work click james comey discussing lynch clinton meeting tarmac loretta lynch testimony congress regarding meeting bill clinton,538,3825
 Amy Schumer Attacks Anti-Choice Republicans In Hilarious New Sketch (VIDEO),"Whenever Amy Schumer has aimed to make a feminist statement, she s hit her mark perfectly. She s back on television for the fourth season of her Comedy Central show  Inside Amy Schumer,  and she s delivered another spot-on sketch about the GOP s never-ending war on women, and the absurdity of male politicians making personal decisions for women.For the show s premiere, Schumer opened with a hilariously accurate skit about women s healthcare. During the sketch, Amy is at her OBGYN s office to get her pap smear when she realizes that instead of her gynecologist, she ll be seen by four politicians from a fictitious House Committee on Women s Health.Schumer demands to know where the real doctor is, and one of the congressmen replies with the very logic that has been used by several GOP lawmakers:  We re the House Committee on Women s Health! So I think we have a better idea than a bunch of science-y nerdles. The four fake congressmen then pull out clipboards and bombard Schumer with a bunch of misogynistic questions about her sex life and vaginal health. They shame Schumer s sexual history, call her menstruation cycle a  lady curse  and refer to tampons as  blood diapers.  One politician is completely silent during the whole thing, aside from randomly inserting  ew  as Schumer tells her ill-advised committee about her vagina or period.The conversation with the clueless politicians goes pretty much exactly how actual discussions with Republican lawmakers go when it comes to women s bodies, their health and their human rights. After getting through all the committee s invasive questions, Schumer finally is ready to get her pap smear. But as she puts her legs in the stirrups, she finds that she is surrounded by an even larger group of male politicians watching her. She objects: What? Wait. I feel a lot more comfortable with a woman in here. Aren t there any women on the Women s Health Committee? Driving Schumer s point home, a congressman giggles and makes the condescending remark, That would be like letting the lions run the zoo!

Burn! Ted Cruz Calls Out The Sierra Club President On His Bogus Global Warming Stats (Video),"This is great! Ted Cruz calls out the Sierra Club President on his bogus 97% scientific consensus on global warming. When asked about the 18 year pause in global warming, as documented by satellite data, Mr. Mair denied it exists.  So if the data are contrary to your testimony, would the Sierra Club issue a retraction?  Cruz asked.  Sir, we concur with the 97 percent scientific consensus with regards to global warming,  Mair responded. After some back and forth between the two, Cruz sent the money shot in with this comment:  You know, Mr. Mair, I find it striking that for a policy organization that purports to focus exclusively on environmental issues, that you are not willing to tell this committee that you would issue a retraction if your testimony is objectively false under scientific data.

RINO SENATOR FLAKE Trashes Trump and Republican Party On Way Out [Video],"The swamp is draining One more RINO is not running for reelection. Senator Jeff Flake announced he will not run again today in a vindictive speech against President Trump and Republicans. Hey, the guy was even thinking of running as an Independent what does that tell you? He s NOT a conservative! He mentioned in his speech that he couldn t support Trump s policies on trade and immigration. Well, those two policies are what got Trump elected!FLAKE WAS 26 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS:The bombshell, which Flake, R-Ariz., detailed Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor, will further roil Republican hopes of keeping the party s 52-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections of Trump s first term, when the president s party historically loses seats in Congress.It also likely will upend the race for Flake s seat.Flake, one of the Senate s more prominent critics of President Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls.A GRANDSTANDING AND VINDICTIVE SPEECH:He told The Arizona Republic ahead of his announcement that he has become convinced  there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party. Flake said he has not  soured on the Senate  and loves the institution, but that as a traditional, libertarian-leaning conservative Republican he is out of step with today s Trump-dominated GOP. This spell will pass, but not by next year,  Flake said.Among Republican primary voters, there s overwhelming support for Trump s positions and  behavior,  Flake said, and one of their top concerns is whether a candidate is with the president or against him. While Flake said he is with Trump on some issues, on other issues he is not. And Trump definitely views him as a foe, having denounced Flake publicly and called him  toxic  on Twitter. Here s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I m not willing to take, and that I can t in good conscience take,  Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview.  It would require me to believe in positions I don t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone. LAURA INGRAHAM COULDN T HAVE SAID IT BETTER:Flake was for the disastrous Trans Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, open immig, blanket amnesty and had Hillary won, he'd be happy today.  Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 24, 2017As of Sept. 30, Flake s campaign had $3.4 million on hand. He has continued to raise money   as recently as Thursday, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice headlined a fundraiser for him in Arizona.Flake said he has ruled out running as an independent rather than a Republican, saying he didn t think that was a viable strategy. He also said he has  no intention  of making a presidential run.SENATE RACE HEATS UP:Kelli Ward, the former state senator from Lake Havasu City who lost her primary challenge last year against Sen. John McCain, has emerged this year as the top GOP alternative to Flake, but other names have been mentioned as possibilities: Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and Arizona Board of Regents member Jay Heiler. Lesser-known Republicans Craig Brittain and Nicholas Tutora also have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are running.But Flake s exit is sure to prompt bigger Arizona Republican names to take a fresh look at the GOP Senate race.Steve Bannon, Trump s controversial former White House strategist, has embraced Ward as part of his national  open revolt  against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the GOP establishment. But other Republicans have warned that Ward is a weak candidate whose nomination would jeopardize GOP chances of holding Arizona s Senate seat.The winner of the Aug. 28 Republican primary could face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., considered the front-runner in her the Democratic Senate primary.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Flake as  one of the finest human beings I ve met in politicsFlake publicly announced his intentions in a Senate floor speech that began around noon Arizona time.In a copy of prepared remarks released to The Republic before his speech, Flake gave a blistering critique of the  coarseness of our national dialogue  that has defined the Trump era, saying it should never become accommodated as a  the new normal.

 Dominican Newspaper Trolls Trump By Using A Photo Of Alec Baldwin (SCREENSHOTS),"Dominican newspaper El Nacional had a bit of fun with our comically inept President* when they  accidentally  used a photo of Trump s arch-nemesis Alec Baldwin instead of our orange-skinned wannabe dictator in a recent story.The story was regarding Trump s upcoming meeting with war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu following the United States  decision to block a Palestinian official from a U.N. appointment for fear it would hurt Bibi s precious little feelings. The United States was disappointed to see a letter indicating the intention to appoint the former Palestinian Authority prime minister to lead the UN Mission in Libya,  unqualified mess of a human being and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said. For too long the U.N. has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel. This, of course, is sure to make Netanyahu happy prior to the meeting, where he and Trump are expected to discuss moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The paper posted what appears to be a  tongue-in-cheek  photo correction, claiming that they were sent the photo by the Associated Press.It is unclear if this was an honest mistake or an  alt-mistake,  but one thing is for certain   Trump is not going to be happy when he sees this.Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 11, 2017",1,dominican newspaper el nacional bit fun comically inept president accidentally used photo trump arch nemesis alec baldwin instead orange skinned wannabe dictator recent story story regarding trump upcoming meeting war criminal benjamin netanyahu following united state decision block palestinian official u n appointment fear would hurt bibi precious little feeling united state disappointed see letter indicating intention appoint former palestinian authority prime minister lead un mission libya unqualified mess human u n ambassador nikki haley said long u n unfairly biased favor palestinian authority detriment ally israel course sure make netanyahu happy prior meeting trump expected discus moving u embassy tel aviv jerusalem paper posted appears tongue cheek photo correction claiming sent photo associated press unclear honest mistake alt mistake one thing certain trump going happy see featured image via screengrab,131,925
BOOM! BRILLIANT ANDREW MCCARTHY Totally Destroys Any Case Against Trump [Video],"Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",1,andrew mccarthy awesome go reason nothing trump tucker carlson even say end interview mccarthy work white house know single person work white house explain thing way love common sense brilliance mccarthy great mccarthy piece national review finally something else lawyer nearly fell chair upon reading first paragraph note clinton interview identifies lawyer clinton permitted present interview among cheryl mill clinton longtime confidant chief staff state department reader may recall suggested back may fix investigation clinton email reason justice department allowing cheryl mill witness subject investigation invoke attorney client privilege behalf mr clinton order thwart fbi attempt inquire procedure used produce clinton email state department mill participant procedure procedure know well 30 000 email attempted destroyed including several thousand contained government related business worked clinton state mill acting capacity lawyer secretary clinton state department moreover clinton chief staff mill intimately involved issue related clinton private email set discussion getting secure blackberry similar president obama question raised including foia request clinton communication say mill actor fact criminal investigation fbi put aside mr clinton lawyer working state department explained may column mill leaving state department barred ethical rule acting mr clinton lawyer connection matter lawyer participated personally substantially public officer employee way mill permitted participate lawyer process producing clinton email state department nearly two year left thought astonishing justice department indulged attorney client privilege claim frustrated fbi ability question key aspect investigation simply unbelievable find turning mr clinton interview participating capacity lawyer circumstance clinton investigated matter mill participated non lawyer government official read nro,251,1908
GERMAN COURT RULES âSharia Policeâ Patrolling City Streets Did NOT Break Lawâ¦INSANE Video Shows Muslim Men Patrolling Streets,"These videos are very disturbing. Americans are headed down this path if we don t fight back against the Left who put political correctness before our national security A German court has ruled that Islamists who patrolled a city s streets as  Sharia police  did not break the law and will not be prosecuted.Here is what a Sharia Patrol looks like:Nine were arrested in September 2014 after patrolling streets in Wuppertal, western Germany. They wore bright orange jackets with the words  Sharia police . They told passers-by not to frequent discos, casinos or bars.The court said they had not violated laws on uniforms and public gatherings.Prosecutors have now lodged an appeal.The group of Salafists   ultra-conservative Islamists   included Sven Lau, a preacher whose passport was seized this year after he visited Syria and a photo surfaced, showing him posing on a tank, with a Kalashnikov rifle slung around his neck. He is suspected of trying to recruit Muslims to join jihadists fighting in Syria or Iraq and has spent some time in prison previously. He said he had gone to war-torn Syria in 2013 on a humanitarian mission.Sharia, the revealed, sacred law of Islam, governs all aspects of a Muslim s life.The group s appearance at night in Wuppertal, in the industrial Ruhr region, triggered sharp criticism in Germany. A film of their  patrol  appeared on YouTube:The action was condemned by the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, who said it was  harmful to Muslims .The group also carried notices proclaiming in English a  Sharia Controlled Zone . The notices spelled out prohibitions like those in force in some Gulf Arab countries, outlawing alcohol, drugs, gambling, music and concerts, pornography and prostitution. Activists in the anti-Islam Pegida movement   campaigning to stop immigration to Germany   demonstrated in Wuppertal last year. They have staged regular marches against  the Islamisation of Germany  nationwide.

WHAT THE HECK Is Going On In Las Vegas? VIDEO PROOF That Las Vegas Coronerâs Office Is On LOCKDOWN,"When people say  What happens in Las Vegas, stays in Las Vegas.  they apparently aren t  kidding around Suspicion about what is going on in the Las Vegas massacre investigation is at an all-time high. Americans want to know, and frankly, we have a right to know what happened in Las Vegas the night of the Rt. 91 Music Festival, where 59 people were killed and 527 were injured.  It s almost eery how quickly the Las Vegas investigation has fallen off the radar of the mainstream media, who don t seem to be interested in finding out what really happened, and even appear to be giving up on using the massacre to promote their gun-control agenda.A worker at the Mandalay Bay hotel said Wednesday that he warned staff at the complex to report an active shooter before gunman Stephen Paddock launched his massacre on crowds at a music festival below the venue.The revelation has added to doubts about the initial timeline given by authorities about what happened Oct. 1. They had said the assault began with Paddock opening fire on concertgoers at the Route 91 Festival.But the new account alleges that an unarmed guard Jesus Campos who was initially believed to have approached and been shot by Paddock during his massacre was shot before the assault, with that gunshot heard by a maintenance worker.JESUS IS BEING PROTECTED BY AN ARMED SECURITY GUARD WHO REFUSES TO SAY WHO S PAYING HIMIndependent investigative journalist Laura Loomer paid a visit to the home of the  hero  Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort  security guard  who was allegedly shot by the Las Vegas shooter Steven Paddock. Loomer can be seen having a conversation with a paid security guard who refused to say who was paying him to stand in front of Campos  home. Who is this guy and why is he there?Watch:Investigative Journalist Laura Loomer visits Mandalay Bay ""Hero"" Security Guard Jesus Campos @ His House @miketokes https://t.co/6L0T6ADzPa  Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) October 12, 2017JESUS CAMPOS DOESN T APPEAR TO BE REGISTERED AS A SECURITY GUARD IN LAS VEGAS AS REQUIRED BY LAWEvery security guard in the state of Nevada has to register as an armed or unarmed guard with the state s Private Investigator s Licensing Board (PILB). This entity s records are publicly searchable at: nevadapilb.glsuite.us.There s no Jesus Campos licensed with the PILB. Here s a close up look at the NV PI Licensing Board:The document above was released by pol News Infinity who has done some amazing investigative work on a number of cases. The pol News Infinity Twitter account has since been SUSPENDED.JESUS CAMPOS IS A NO SHOW FOR PRESS CONFERENCE AND SEAN HANNITY INTERVIEWThe same day that Loomer paid a visit to Campos  home, Jesus Campos had a press conference and interview with Sean Hannity scheduled for later in the day. Campos abruptly canceled the press conference and the interview with Sean Hannity.Media scrum tonight as we learn security officer shot in Vegas attack, Jesus Campos  whereabouts are unknown. pic.twitter.com/Jk09tRlPsX  Stephanie Wash (@WashNews) October 13, 2017We were in a room and we came out and he was gone,  Campos  union president told reporters, according to ABC News  Stephanie Wash.Campos is represented by the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, which did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News earlier this week.Fox News  Sean Hannity tweeted out that Campos, who was scheduled to appear on  Hannity  Thursday night,  cancelled  his appearance.He cancelled. https://t.co/fWCb4X8cNQ  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 13, 2017JESUS CAMPOS AGREES TO GIVE A  SCRIPTED  INTERVIEW WITH ELLEN DEGENERES ON HER SHOW. HIS APPEARANCE ON THE SHOW IS SHOCKINGLY DIFFERENT THAN THE IMAGE THAT  S BEEN CIRCULATING OF HIM IN THE MEDIAAn announcement was made last week that Jesus Campus would appear on the Ellen Show. Jesus did appear on the show, but given the original photo of Campos that was being used in the media and a quick snapshot from his appearance on the Ellen Show, two things really jump out. The first thing that jumps out is the incredible 1-week weight gain that Campos had experienced, and the second is the missing moles that were very prominent in the photo below, that was allegedly taken only one week before his  performance  on the Ellen Show.#Jesuscampos in 5 days, gained 50 LB, had moles removed from his face, has no injury to forehead but had bandage on it 5 days before? pic.twitter.com/TlT6Mt0eyZ  Fed Up Lilly   (@FedUpLilly) October 21, 2017MGM ADMITS TO ALLOWING CAMPOS TO ONLY APPEAR ON THE ELLEN SHOW IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE HE KEPT HIS STORY STRAIGHTFearing Jesus Campos would  spill the beans  about the timeline of the shooting if he was grilled by proper journalists, MGM, which owns the hotel where deranged gunman Stephen Paddock shot 600 people, insisted that security officer appear ONLY on only appear on Ellen, DailyMail.com has learned exclusively.MGM is worried that families of the 58 people murdered as well as many of the 546 injured in the Mandalay Bay massacre will launch lawsuits potentially worth billions of dollars against the company, sources tell DailyMail.com.And they thought Campos might not keep his story straight under the pressure of the TV lights and tough questioning.That is why Campos, 25, appeared on a daytime chat show hosted by a fast-talking, dancing comedienne, rather than take questions from TV hardhitters such as Fox News  Sean Hannity, CNN s Wolf Blitzer or MSNBC s Rachel Maddow. MGM was behind the decision to call off all the interviews and did a deal with Ellen, knowing she would not play hardball on the timeline as long as she had the exclusive,  a TV insider told DailyMail.com.Here s a closer look at the images:And now, citizen journalist Mike Tokes has uncovered what is indeed a very suspicious development. Tokes traveled to the Las Vegas coroners office to see if he could get some answers from the Clark County Coroner and Medical Examiner John Fudenberg. What Tokes got when he attempted to enter the Las Vegas Coroner s office was a woman by the name of  Laurie  who informed him that the coroner s office was on lockdown and would remain on lockdown  at least until the end of the week . When Tokes asked if it was unusual for the office to be on lockdown, she replied,  We ve never had a situation like this.

She can be heard telling the dispatch operator for her cab service that she hears what  sounds like automatic gunfire.  Cori Langdon hears more gunfire, and tells her dispatch operator that the gunshots sound like they re coming from a completely different area:  Now it sounds like its coming from farther away. After listening to Langdon s video recording of the event as it unfolded, one can t help but wonder if it s possible there was more than one shooter.Automatic gunshots are still being heard from the cab. Langdon tells her dispatch person:  Somethings going on. I m not sure why people aren t  running, but. There s a security guard, what s he doing? Ya know, for there being gunfire, it sure doesn t seem like people are runnin .  Oh, shit! Seriously? I don t know what s goin  on? Where are the cops at? I m right here by the porch of Mandalay Bay, and everything seems to be normal here.  More and more rapid-fire gunshots are heard. The radio dispatcher replies,  Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. And everything seems normal when it s not.

 CNNâs Resident Racist Just Told Us How He Thinks Obama Should Solve Violence In America (VIDEO),"CNN s supposed law enforcement expert, Harry Houck, is promoting a new video with what he no doubt thinks is an absolutely brilliant message. He wants President Obama to solve violence, and he even has a suggestion for how best to do it. There is a video floating around social media that calls on Obama to  ban niggas, not guns,  in order to stop escalating violence in America s cities. To a racist like Houck, this makes perfect sense.He posted a link to the video on his Twitter account, and said: He knows what he s talking about! Because the man who made the video, Tommy Sotomayor, is black, and therefore that makes this okay. Watch the video in all its racist, bigoted glory below:The video appeared on a Facebook page called  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children  about a week ago, but Houck seems to have just now noticed it, and it s awful message resonated with him, because of course. One only needs to look at his Twitter feed to see how racist he is. He s called for Donald Trump, Jr., to be the new mayor of New York City, and he s screamed,  Death to political correctness!  there when he hears the word,  racism. He also uses his spot on CNN to say that black people are more predisposed to committing crimes, and that black victims of police brutality have nobody to blame but themselves for it (those who survive, anyway). He said that on CNN just two weeks ago, in fact, which threw CNN s panel at the time into an uproar.He s even tweeted a link to a white supremacist website. Yes, Houck is clearly a wonderful law enforcement expert who should definitely be taken seriously. Not. In truth, he needs to be removed from the air for promoting racial hatred.Featured image via screen capture",News,"July 25, 2016",1,cnn supposed law enforcement expert harry houck promoting new video doubt think absolutely brilliant message want president obama solve violence even suggestion best video floating around social medium call obama ban nigga gun order stop escalating violence america city racist like houck make perfect sense posted link video twitter account said know talking man made video tommy sotomayor black therefore make okay watch video racist bigoted glory video appeared facebook page called uncle sam misguided child week ago houck seems noticed awful message resonated course one need look twitter feed see racist called donald trump jr new mayor new york city screamed death political correctness hears word racism also us spot cnn say black people predisposed committing crime black victim police brutality nobody blame survive anyway said cnn two week ago fact threw cnn panel time uproar even tweeted link white supremacist website yes houck clearly wonderful law enforcement expert definitely taken seriously truth need removed air promoting racial hatred featured image via screen capture,165,1090
 Conservative Supreme Court Ruling Just Gave The Oil Companies A Big Win,"In what is considered a massive set-back not just to Obama s environmental policy, but to the very planet we live on, the Supreme Court just killed the best chance America had to combat climate change in the foreseeable future. And if you think this wasn t politically motivated   the five Justices responsible all come from the right side of the bench.In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled to stay the requirements that energy companies needed to rein in the ludicrous amount of carbon that they were pouring into the atmosphere. For decades, scientists have warned that this carbon is among the number one contributors to global warming. Obama had hoped to address this with a landmark move to curtail these emissions with an initiative he named the  Clean Power Plan. With strong but achievable standards for power plants, and customized goals for states to cut the carbon pollution that is driving climate change, the Clean Power Plan provides national consistency, accountability and a level playing field while reflecting each state s energy mix. It also shows the world that the United States is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change.Or not.Instead, America s right-wing showed the world once again that it is not remotely serious about trying to combat climate change. Naturally, this lack of initiative gives other major polluters like China a fantastic excuse to not curtail their own emissions. We will, when you do, they might say.For now, the oil and gas companies get to ignore the rule. This is a major victory for the corporations that are most responsible for polluting in the first place. The Koch brothers, of course, were vehemently opposed to the new plans. So too were the Republican politicians they sponsor. How desperate were Republicans to let their pollution-heavy friends off the hook? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell broke with all existing protocol to deliver a letter to all 50 United States governors telling them to simply ignore Obama s EPA requirements altogether.The four liberal justices   Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan   all wrote that they objected to the stay.But if all of this shady monkey wrench tossing is giving you a sense of hopeless, the silver lining is this: All that is standing in the way of bold new plans like this becoming law are five aging conservative members of the Supreme Court. It s expected that the next president will get to appoint at least two new Justices. The ability to change the course of not just America s, but the world s climate rests with who Americans chose as their next president this year. That s a lot of power. Let s use it to elect a person who has our interests in mind, not the Koch brothers.Feature image from YouTube ",News,"February 9, 2016",1,considered massive set back obama environmental policy planet live supreme court killed best chance america combat climate change foreseeable future think politically motivated five justice responsible come right side bench 5 4 ruling supreme court ruled stay requirement energy company needed rein ludicrous amount carbon pouring atmosphere decade scientist warned carbon among number one contributor global warming obama hoped address landmark move curtail emission initiative named clean power plan strong achievable standard power plant customized goal state cut carbon pollution driving climate change clean power plan provides national consistency accountability level playing field reflecting state energy mix also show world united state committed leading global effort address climate change instead america right wing showed world remotely serious trying combat climate change naturally lack initiative give major polluter like china fantastic excuse curtail emission might say oil gas company get ignore rule major victory corporation responsible polluting first place koch brother course vehemently opposed new plan republican politician sponsor desperate republican let pollution heavy friend hook senate majority leader mitch mcconnell broke existing protocol deliver letter 50 united state governor telling simply ignore obama epa requirement altogether four liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor elena kagan wrote objected stay shady monkey wrench tossing giving sense hopeless silver lining standing way bold new plan like becoming law five aging conservative member supreme court expected next president get appoint least two new justice ability change course america world climate rest american chose next president year lot power let use elect person interest mind koch brother feature image youtube,258,1848
